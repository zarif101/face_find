# Best Results
- The best I've been able to obtain in terms of accuracy is about 65% on the test set, using model 1 with 30 epochs and .00005 learning rate. However, it was definitely very overfit, and model 2 (.00008 learning rate) which performs better in that regard, has 61% on the test set. Please let me know (see README for email) if you achieve better!
- Model 2 seems to work best in real time
- Test set accuracy of around 60% is fine, because in real time the model must determine all images of a person to match the frame
- Threshold of 50-55 seems to work best
- Overall best results for me has been with model 2, .00008 learning rate with 37 epochs.
